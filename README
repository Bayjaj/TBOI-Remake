Okay so since I did this on my main desktop, when I'm ready to move it to my laptop I have to remember to:

1. Open the pngs and files and what not

2. REDOWNLOAD javafx on my laptop and make sure to put the following line of code (with the correct file path ofcourse) also right click resources < build path < use as source

3. Maybe I will have to reinstall javaSE-22? or I also installed jdk22.0.2 from oracle from my program files so maybe I will have to install that on my laptop?

4. After looking through files of other players games I realized I could have set up a package for sound and make a public final class for SFX that made
	the values strings so like MENU = "\menu.mp3" or whatever but I ran out of time could be something I do in the future for fun and to better organize code
	the real goal is to just make mods for this actual game
	
5. I made it so the main thing is actually the SplashScreen instead of Main.java but whateves
	
	
	
**Game TO-DOs:**


- Player death screen fix UI
- 3 Items (1 for 2x damage tears (change color), 1 for further range (1.5x pixel distance or you can just do bigger tears, or can do size up on the player literally infinite choices, I can also make it that upon enemy death, 1/4 chance to get a heart on death)
- 5+ Rooms (3 item room with 1 pedastols (1 for bigger tears, 1 for quicker tears or 2x damage tears or something), 1 spawn room with nothing, 1 boss room, and 2+ normal fighting rooms with enemies)
- constantly updating map of the rooms in the top left
- Make it so isaac's image changes as he turns left right up down
- Add ALL sound fx that I don't currently have (item picked up, enemy sounds, tear shoot, tear land, )
- FIX the sizing of the game based on the device that they are playing on!!! Just tried this on my laptop and size is off
- Volume mixing 
- Comment and cleanup/organize code (structure, unnecessary pieces, unused headers)

- If it's forced, make it so the user can choose their name and ill have to find a way to make that useful


Too little time but would be very cool:
- creating several floors to beat
- room randomization
- item randomization
- genuine animations, as in smooth transitions between screens and menus and sprites and stuff
- Options menu functionality
